# Key Pages/Sections for a Portfolio Website

2. **About**
    - This page gives more detailed information about you. You can talk about your education, skills, hobbies, values, and your journey in programming/DevOps.

3. **Resume / CV**
    - It's great to have a downloadable version of your resume or CV. This should include your education, experience, certifications, skills, and contact information.
